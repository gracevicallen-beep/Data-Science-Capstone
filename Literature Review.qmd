## Literature Review

#### Pingping Zhou

Fraud detection has become increasingly reliant on advanced statistical
and machine learning approaches due to the complexity and evolving
nature of fraudulent behaviors. Among these approaches, Generalized
Additive Models (GAMs) provide a balance between predictive flexibility
and interpretability, making them especially suitable for domains where
explainability is critical, such as finance, auditing, and
cybersecurity.

1.  @Tragouda_2024 highlight GAMs’ ability to balance interpretability
    and predictive performance in fraud detection, such as bank cheque
    fraud. While challenges like uneven data and changing fraud patterns
    reduce precision (5.6%) but maintain recall (77.8%), GAMs provide
    clear explanations for regulators. Combining GAMs with other models
    can enhance accuracy while keeping results interpretable for legal
    and ethical oversight.

2.  @Miller_2025 investigates GAMs for identifying fraudulent financial
    statements, often hidden in complex accounting data. GAMs, combined
    with models like random forests, detect irregular revenue patterns
    and generate interpretable visualizations for auditors. Although
    effective, GAMs may miss sophisticated frauds involving multiple
    interacting factors. They provide a strong balance of accuracy and
    clarity for early detection of financial fraud.

3.  @Hanagandi_2023 explore regularized generalized linear models,
    including Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet, for detecting credit card
    fraud in highly imbalanced datasets (0.17% fraud cases). These
    models, similar to GAMs, capture complex transaction patterns while
    remaining interpretable. Ridge regression achieved high accuracy (up
    to 98.2%). The study highlights that careful data preparation is
    crucial for effective real-time fraud detection in banking
    environments.

4.  @Brossart_2015 discuss the application of GAMs to Medicare claims
    data for identifying fraudulent billing and overcharging. GAMs
    effectively detect unusual patterns and provide clear
    visualizations, which enhance auditor trust. While highly
    interpretable, they can be less adaptive to emerging fraud patterns
    compared to more complex models, but their transparency makes them
    valuable for healthcare fraud investigations.

5.  @Chang_2022 introduced Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) as an
    extension of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for graph-structured
    data, enabling fraud detection in domains such as financial
    transaction networks and social platforms. GNANs combine graph
    neural networks with additive modeling, capturing complex relational
    patterns while maintaining interpretability through simple
    visualizations. Their approach achieved strong predictive
    performance, reaching 84.5% ROC-AUC in detecting banned or
    suspicious users, while also providing clear, auditable explanations
    that satisfy regulatory compliance.

6.  In telecom fraud detection, @Zhang_2025 introduced a graph-based
    framework that used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) as a baseline
    for comparison. The study highlighted that GAMs are effective for
    modeling nonlinear patterns in sequential data, such as call
    frequency and duration, which are important for detecting fraudulent
    behavior. However, the results showed that GAMs were outperformed by
    graph neural networks (GNNs) in capturing complex network
    interactions, suggesting that GAMs are more appropriate for simpler
    fraud detection tasks where interpretability is prioritized over
    modeling intricate relationships (Zhang et al., 2025).

1.  @Hastie_1986 introduced GAMs as an extension of generalized linear
    models by replacing the linear predictor with an additive
    combination of smooth functions of covariates. This approach
    provides flexibility to capture nonlinear effects while remaining
    interpretable, making GAMs a balance between fully parametric and
    nonparametric methods. Their work established the foundation for
    modern GAM applications, including the backfitting algorithm,
    smoothing methods, and practical ways to select model complexity.

2.  @Guisan_2002 reviewed the application of generalized linear and
    additive models in ecology, with a focus on species distributions.
    They noted that while generalized linear models are easier to
    interpret, they are limited in their ability to capture curved
    patterns in ecological data. GAMs, on the other hand, better
    represent nonlinear species–environment relationships but carry
    risks of overfitting, reduced interpretability, and misleading
    predictions when applied outside observed data ranges. The authors
    emphasized careful variable selection, model validation, and
    consideration of data quality.

3.  @White_2020 provided a tutorial that used GAMs to evaluate alcohol
    consumption as a health exposure variable. By applying GAMs in R and
    SAS, they demonstrated how nonlinear associations can be identified
    where linear assumptions fail. Their results showed that GAMs are
    powerful for visualizing complex patterns but have limitations when
    it comes to making formal inference on nonlinear effects. This makes
    them especially useful as exploratory tools, though the subjectivity
    involved in smoothing parameter selection was also noted as a
    limitation.

4.  @Miller_2025 presented GAMs from a Bayesian perspective, framing
    smoothing penalties and variable selection as Bayesian priors. This
    approach highlights how uncertainty can be measured using credible
    intervals rather than traditional confidence intervals, which may be
    more informative in sparse data situations. Miller also discussed
    shrinkage methods that help simplify GAMs by reducing unnecessary
    terms. However, most GAMs still rely on empirical Bayes approaches
    rather than fully Bayesian models, and smoothing remains partly
    subjective.

5.  @Wood_2025 reviewed advances in GAM methodology, including
    computational improvements that allow GAMs to be applied to larger
    datasets. He emphasized automated smoothing parameter selection,
    scalable algorithms, and extensions to models beyond the mean, such
    as location–scale modeling and quantile regression. His work also
    highlighted the use of tensor-product splines and isotropic smooths
    for modeling interactions across variables with different scales,
    making GAMs applicable to more complex research questions.

6.  @Detmer_2025 tested GAMs as tools for detecting thresholds in
    ecological systems, such as abrupt changes in species response to
    environmental variables. Through simulation studies and a case
    application to Pacific hake distribution, the study found that GAMs
    perform well under conditions with long, high-quality datasets but
    are less reliable with short or noisy time series. The findings
    stress the importance of data quality and model validation, as GAMs
    may detect false thresholds if conditions are not suitable.
