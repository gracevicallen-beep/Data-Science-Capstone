<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The introduction should:
Develop a storyline that captures attention and maintains interest.
Your audience is your peers
Clearly state the problem or question you're addressing.
<!-- -->
Introduce why it is relevant needs.
Provide an overview of your approach.
Example of writing including citing references:
This is an introduction to ..... regression, which is a non-parametric estimator that estimates the conditional expectation of two variables which is random. The goal of a kernel regression is to discover the non-linear relationship between two random variables. To discover the non-linear relationship, kernel estimator or kernel smoothing is the main method to estimate the curve for non-parametric statistics. In kernel estimator, weight function is known as kernel function [@efr2008]. Cite this paper [@bro2014principal]. The GEE [@wang2014]. The PCA [@daffertshofer2004pca]. Topology can be used in machine learning [@adams2021topology]
For Symbolic Regression [@wang2019symbolic] This is my work and I want to add more work...

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
Detail the models or algorithms used.
Justify your choices based on the problem and data.
The common non-parametric regression model is $Y_i = m(X_i) + \varepsilon_i$, where $Y_i$ can be defined as the sum of the regression function value $m(x)$ for $X_i$. Here $m(x)$ is unknown and $\varepsilon_i$ some errors. With the help of this definition, we can create the estimation for local averaging i.e. $m(x)$ can be estimated with the product of $Y_i$ average and $X_i$ is near to $x$. In other words, this means that we are discovering the line through the data points with the help of surrounding data points. The estimation formula is printed below [@R-base]:
$$
M_n(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} W_n (X_i) Y_i  \tag{1}
$$$W_n(x)$ is the sum of weights that belongs to all real numbers. Weights are positive numbers and small if $X_i$ is far from $x$.
Another equation:
$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 +\varepsilon_i
$$
