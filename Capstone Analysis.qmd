## Introduction

Generalized additive models (GAMs) have emerged as a powerful extension
of generalized linear models (GLMs), providing a flexible framework for
modeling nonlinear relationships while maintaining interpretability.
First introduced by Hastie and Tibshirani (1986), GAMs replace the
linear predictor in GLMs with an additive combination of smooth
functions of covariates.

Since their introduction, GAMs have been widely applied across diverse
fields. Early ecological research highlighted their ability to model
species–environment relationships, capturing nonlinear associations more
effectively than traditional linear models (Guisan, Edwards, & Hastie,
2002). Wood (2025) provides a comprehensive overview of GAM methodology,
detailing their computational foundations, approaches to smoothing
parameter estimation, and extensions to more complex modeling tasks such
as location–scale modeling and quantile regression. More recent work has
incorporated Bayesian perspectives, showing how smoothing penalties and
shrinkage can be interpreted as priors, enhancing model selection and
uncertainty estimation (Miller, 2025). These methodological developments
underscore GAMs’ versatility as both a rigorous and interpretable
statistical tool.

Practical applications further illustrate the adaptability of GAMs. For
example, GAMs have been used in finance to detect patterns indicative of
fraud, balancing predictive performance with interpretability in
datasets where transparency is critical (Tragouda et al., 2024; Miller,
2025). Similar approaches have been applied in healthcare to identify
unusual billing patterns and in networked data through graph neural
additive networks, which combine the interpretability of GAMs with the
representational power of neural networks. Across these examples, GAMs
consistently provide insight into complex, nonlinear relationships while
retaining the ability to explain results to stakeholders.

Building on this foundation, our project applies GAMs to the Fraud
Detection Transactions Dataset from Kaggle (Ashar, 2023), a synthetic
but realistic dataset designed to simulate patterns of financial fraud.
Using RStudio and the **mgcv** package, we will conduct a series of GAM
analyses to identify which variables within the dataset serve as
significant indicators of fraud. This approach allows us to explore GAM
methodology in practice, evaluating both model performance and
interpretability while gaining hands-on experience with smoothing,
variable selection, and visualization techniques in a real-world-style
dataset.

## Methods

Formally, a GAM can be expressed as:

$$ g(\mu) = \alpha + s_1(X_1) + s_2(X_2) + \dots + s_p(X_p) $$

where $g(\mu)$ is the link function (e.g., logit for binary outcomes or
identity for continuous outcomes), $\alpha$ is the intercept, and
$s_j(X_j)$ are smooth functions of the predictor variables $X_j$. This
structure allows each predictor to contribute a smoothed effect to the
model, capturing complex patterns in the data without obscuring the
individual influence of each variable. By balancing flexibility and
clarity, GAMs offer a practical alternative to fully nonparametric
methods, which can become computationally intensive and difficult to
interpret. The additive smooth functions $s_j(X_j)$ are at the heart of
GAMs, enabling the model to uncover nonlinear patterns while maintaining
interpretability for each predictor.
