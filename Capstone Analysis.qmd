## Introduction

Grace intro:

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) build on traditional regression
methods by allowing more flexible and nonlinear relationships between
predictors and outcomes. Early work introduced GAMs as an extension of
generalized linear models that can capture complex patterns in data that
linear models often miss [@Hastie_1986]. Later research focused on
improving how GAMs are fit, making them more efficient and able to
handle larger datasets [@Detmer_2025]. These models have been widely
applied in different fields, such as ecology and biostatistics, where
they have been used to study species distributions [@Guisan_2002],
detect ecological thresholds [@Detmer_2025], and explore health outcomes
like alcohol consumption [@White_2020]. Together, these studies show
that GAMs are useful for uncovering hidden structure in data, but they
also highlight challenges such as the risk of overfitting, difficulty of
interpretation, and reliance on data quality.

More recent work has provided additional perspective on how GAMs operate
and when they are most reliable. A Bayesian approach has helped explain
how smoothing and variable selection can be understood as adding
structure to the model, while also giving clearer ways to measure
uncertainty [@Miller_2025]. At the same time, studies show that GAMs
perform best when data are rich and patterns are strong, while noisy or
sparse datasets can lead to misleading results [@Detmer_2025;
@Guisan_2002]. This makes GAMs well-suited as exploratory models that
highlight important nonlinear relationships, but less suited for drawing
final conclusions on their own. For our project on fraud detection,
these insights are valuable because they justify using GAMs to reveal
complex patterns in financial data, while reminding us to be careful
about issues like overfitting, noise, and interpretability.

Building on this foundation, our project applies GAMs to the Fraud
Detection Transactions Dataset from Kaggle [@Ashar_2024], a synthetic
but realistic dataset designed to simulate patterns of financial fraud.
Using RStudio and the mgcv package, we will conduct a series of GAM
analyses to identify which variables within the dataset serve as
significant indicators of fraud. This approach allows us to explore GAM
methodology in practice, evaluating both model performance and
interpretability while gaining hands-on experience with smoothing,
variable selection, and visualization techniques in a real-world-style
dataset.

Pingping intro:

Fraud detection has become increasingly reliant on advanced statistical
and machine learning approaches due to the complexity and evolving
nature of fraudulent behaviors. Among these approaches, Generalized
Additive Models (GAMs) offer a strong balance between predictive
flexibility and interpretability, making them particularly valuable in
domains where explainability is critical, such as finance, auditing,
healthcare, and cybersecurity.

Recent studies highlight both the strengths and limitations of GAMs in
fraud detection. For example, @Tragouda_2024 demonstrated the
effectiveness of GAMs in detecting bank cheque fraud, showing that while
uneven data and shifting fraud patterns reduced precision (5.6%), GAMs
maintained high recall (77.8%) and provided regulator-friendly
explanations. Similarly, @Miller_2025 applied GAMs to fraudulent
financial statements, showing that combining GAMs with models like
random forests can uncover irregular revenue patterns and provide
auditors with interpretable visualizations. In healthcare,
@Brossart_2015 used GAMs to identify fraudulent Medicare billing, where
their transparency built auditor trust, though they were less adaptive
to emerging fraud patterns.

Other interpretable methods, such as regularized generalized linear
models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet), have also proven effective in
fraud detection. @Hanagandi_2023 applied these models to highly
imbalanced credit card fraud datasets, achieving strong performance (up
to 98.2% accuracy with Ridge regression) and showing that careful data
preparation is crucial for real-time detection.

Beyond traditional GAMs, newer extensions demonstrate how fraud
detection can benefit from graph-based modeling. @Chang_2022 introduced
Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs), which extend GAMs to
graph-structured data such as transactions or social networks. GNANs
maintain interpretability while capturing complex relational patterns,
achieving 84.5% ROC-AUC in detecting banned or suspicious users.
Similarly, @Zhang_2025 explored telecom fraud detection using
graph-based frameworks, finding that GAMs effectively modeled sequential
features like call frequency and duration but were outperformed by graph
neural networks (GNNs) in capturing complex network interactions. These
findings suggest that while GAMs remain valuable for interpretable,
regulator-friendly fraud detection, newer graph-based models offer
improved performance when modeling intricate, interconnected data.

Sonya intro:

Advancements in data science and machine learning have reshaped how
organizations detect and prevent fraudulent financial activity. Recent
research emphasizes the growing importance of interpretable and adaptive
modeling frameworks—particularly Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and
their neural extensions—for balancing predictive accuracy with
transparency. In financial and regulatory contexts, where accountability
and explainability are crucial, these models offer a vital bridge
between traditional statistical analysis and modern deep learning.
Studies such as @Zhu_2023 demonstrate the promise of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in fraud detection by producing synthetic
transaction data that enhance model robustness against class imbalance.
Similarly, @Agarwal_2021 introduce Neural Additive Models (NAMs), which
retain the interpretability of GAMs while integrating neural networks to
capture nonlinear relationships in complex datasets.

Emerging innovations continue to expand the GAM framework.
@GAMformer_2023 applies transformer architectures to in-context
learning, streamlining the estimation of smooth functions and improving
computational efficiency. Functional and Dynamic Generalized Additive
Models [@FGAM_2015; @DGAM_2021] further extend this methodology by
addressing functional predictors and temporal dependencies, enhancing
model flexibility for forecasting and time-series applications. Tools
such as the @GamHP_2020 strengthen interpretability by quantifying each
predictor’s contribution, allowing for clearer evaluation of model
importance. Collectively, these advances mark a shift toward hybrid
analytical approaches that preserve the interpretability of statistical
models while leveraging the computational strength of modern neural
systems.

Together, these studies establish a methodological foundation for
applying interpretable machine learning techniques to fraud detection.
Their emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and adaptability aligns
directly with this capstone’s objective: to develop models that can
detect fraudulent transactions effectively while maintaining clear and
defensible decision processes.

Kesi intro:

## Methods

Formally, a GAM can be expressed as:

$$ g(\mu) = \alpha + s_1(X_1) + s_2(X_2) + \dots + s_p(X_p) $$

where $g(\mu)$ is the link function (e.g., logit for binary outcomes or
identity for continuous outcomes), $\alpha$ is the intercept, and
$s_j(X_j)$ are smooth functions of the predictor variables $X_j$. This
structure allows each predictor to contribute a smoothed effect to the
model, capturing complex patterns in the data without obscuring the
individual influence of each variable. By balancing flexibility and
clarity, GAMs offer a practical alternative to fully nonparametric
methods, which can become computationally intensive and difficult to
interpret. The additive smooth functions $s_j(X_j)$ are at the heart of
GAMs, enabling the model to uncover nonlinear patterns while maintaining
interpretability for each predictor.

## Analysis and Results

### Data Exploration and Visualization

#### **Data set Description**

The Fraud Detection Transactions Dataset [@Ashar_2024] is a meticulously
crafted, synthetic dataset that replicates real-world financial
transaction patterns, making it a robust resource for building and
testing fraud detection models. Hosted on Kaggle, it is tailored for
binary classification tasks, with transactions labeled as fraudulent (1)
or non-fraudulent (0), and is designed to simulate the complexity of
financial systems while ensuring ethical data usage by avoiding real
user information. The dataset’s realistic design captures nuanced fraud
patterns, such as clustered fraudulent transactions, subtle anomalies,
or irregular user behaviors, providing a challenging yet representative
environment for machine learning applications in anomaly detection, risk
assessment, and fraud prevention.

The dataset’s synthetic nature replicates realistic fraud patterns,
including clustered fraudulent transactions, subtle anomalies, and
irregular user behaviors, while avoiding privacy concerns. Although the
exact number of records is unspecified, the data set is designed to be
sufficiently large and diverse, with a mix of typical transactions and
rare fraudulent events to address class imbalance — a common challenge
in fraud detection. Potential data quality issues, such as noisy data,
missing values, or outliers, reflect real-world complexities and require
preprocessing steps like data cleaning, categorical encoding, or
normalization. These challenges necessitate robust modeling techniques
to handle noise and ensure accurate predictions.

#### **Key Characteristics**

The dataset simulates real-world financial transaction patterns,
capturing diverse user behaviors and transaction characteristics while
ensuring ethical data usage through its synthetic design. It is tailored
for binary classification tasks, with transactions labeled as fraudulent
(1) or non-fraudulent (0), and includes 21 features categorized as
follows:

-   **Size and Scope:** Contains thousands of individual transactions,
    each labeled as either fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

-   **Features (21 total):**

    -   Numerical variables: transaction amounts, risk scores, balances,
        and other continuous measures.

    -   Categorical variables: transaction types (e.g., payment,
        transfer, withdrawal), device types, and merchant categories.

    -   Temporal variables: transaction time, day, and sequencing
        patterns that capture behavioral dynamics.

-   **Label Distribution:** Fraudulent transactions represent a small
    percentage of the data, reflecting the real-world class imbalance in
    fraud detection problems.

-   **Realism:** Although synthetic, the dataset mirrors real-world
    fraud scenarios by including behavioral signals, unusual spending
    patterns, and high-risk profiles.

**Flexibility:** Supports various modeling approaches, from
interpretable methods (e.g., GAMs, logistic regression) to
high-performance ensemble models (e.g., XGBoost).
